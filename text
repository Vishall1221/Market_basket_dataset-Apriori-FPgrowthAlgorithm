How can the FP-Growth algorithm be implemented in Python to analyze a retail transaction dataset, and what steps are involved in preparing the data, generating frequent itemsets, and deriving association rules? Additionally, what insights can be gained from the results regarding customer purchasing patterns? To illustrate the implementation of the FP-growth algorithm, Use the marketbasked optimization dataset and comparsion btw execution Times with Apriori algorithm
